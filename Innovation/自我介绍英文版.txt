I certainly very much enjoy working with others; 
I’m outgoing, I enjoy the team spirit and I’m understanding of the needs of others.
I’m good at helping the team to see the bigger picture and help them to focus on what is really matters rather than getting bogged down in irrelevant detail. 
I’m also good at helping the team to spot flaws in our approach and potential problems. 
I believe I have strong communication skills and, while I don’t yet have experience in a leadership role, I do have a talent for communicating with different team members and resolving any problems which may arise. 
Conflict between different team members is rarely very productive and is normally best avoided.

我当然非常享受和别人合作的过程。我性格外向，欣赏团队精神，我也了解他人想要什么。我擅长帮助整个团队掌握大局――从树木中看到森林――帮助他们专注于最重要的事而不是纠结于不相关的小细节。我还很擅长帮助团队找到工作中的不足之处，发现潜在的问题，避免陷阱。我的沟通能力很强，虽然我没有在团队中担当过领导角色，但是我善于联络不同的团队成员，解决纠纷，因此团队成员发生的冲突很少会恶化并且能很好地解决
